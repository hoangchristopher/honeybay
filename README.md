## project overviewhttps://github.com/hoangchristopher/honeybay/blob/main/README.md
BeeSure is an innovative XR (Extended Reality) experience designed to make cerebellar exams more accessible and engaging for patients at home. With many patients facing barriers to visiting healthcare facilities, this project offers a convenient, interactive way for them to monitor their health from the comfort of their own homes. Through two game-like stages, users can perform cerebellar self-assessments, and their performance data is collected and shared with their doctors for customized feedback. The goal is to reduce healthcare expenses and promote greater participation in self-monitoring.

<br>

## technical overview
<br>
BeeSure is built using Unity and Meta Quest 3, combining both platforms to create an immersive VR experience. It incorporates two established cerebellar exam methods‚ÄîFinger-to-Nose and Rapid Alternating Movements‚Äîtransforming these techniques into interactive and fun VR challenges.
<h4> Main Features: </h4>
<li> Game 1: Rapid Alternating Movements (RAM) </li>
Players simulate the Rapid Alternating Movements test by flipping their hands repeatedly to steer a boat toward an island, assessing their cerebellar coordination.
<li> Game 2: Finger-to-Nose </li>
In this game, players collect apples from a tree and place them into a basket, mimicking the Finger-to-Nose test used for cerebellar examination.
<li> Data Collection and Feedback </li>

<br>
Throughout the games, performance data is gathered and sent to healthcare providers. This information, along with recorded gameplay footage, enables doctors to evaluate the patient's condition and deliver personalized feedback.


<h4> Tools and Technologies: </h4>
<li> Unity: The platform used to create the interactive VR environment. </li>
<li> Meta Quest 3: The VR headset that provides an immersive experience for users. </li>
<li> C#: The programming language used to develop game mechanics within Unity. </li>
